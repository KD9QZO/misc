# APRS #

As many in the _amateur radio community_ are already familiar with [**APRS**][1] _(Automatic Packet Reporting System)_, I do not feel the need to explain its purpose here.


## Goals ##

As [**APRS**][1] is already a well-establised, well-defined system and has enjoyed a widespread userbase throughout the _amateur radio community_ (in terms of hardware vendors,
software vendors, and users), we feel no need to _"re-invent the wheel"_; alas, some amazing innovations have been built _"on-top"_ of the [**APRS**][1] infrastructure _(see some
examples below)_. Our goal is to further enhance the _existing_ system, and innovate based on those solid foundations.


## Examples ##

As mentioned above, there are many wonderful enhancements to the [**APRS**][1] system already; I've listed a few below:

- [`SMSGTE`][2] -- A versatile, and incredibly useful gateway between the world of [**APRS**][1] and the more _"consumer-friendly"_ form of text-based communication: **SMS**
- `WXBOT` -- An automated method of retreiving the weather for a specified location by way of sending an [**APRS**][1] message containing the location of interest
- [aprs.fi][3] -- An interactive, [Google Maps][4]-based interface to [**APRS**][1] stations which report their location data
- _(many more I am likely either unaware of, or forgetting at the time of writing)_
